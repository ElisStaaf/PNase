    NASE:                      Dec 2024

Hello there! I just want to clarify some things! I (@ElisStaaf), did
*not* make NASE. This is a patched version of NASE, because I wanted
to make my own Algol60 programs. When I ran the code, it didn't work.
So, I just patched it up. You're in reality running a slightly modified
version of NASE A60 V0.22 when you install this. You should see NASE's
official website at <https://www.bertnase.de/a60>. I am going to keep
the original license and copying permissions as NASE A60 V0.22.

Sincerely, Elis Staaf.

This is the Algol 60 interpreter NASE A60 (now around version 0.21).
Made for fun and call-by-name.

The NASE A60 interpreter is free software.  See the file COPYING for
copying permission.

About compiling and installation see the file INSTALL (or simply run
./configure followed by a make install ;-).

NASE A60 is based on the ``Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language
Algol 60'' (The file RRA60.texinfo contains a source form of the
report, RRA60*.ps a formatted versions; it is not covererd by the
COPYING permissions).

The I/O section of the interpreter is not complete at all, but basic
things are now working.

About the interpreter:  There is now the a60.texinfo documentation,
but not finished at all - sorry.

Additionally there is the ``xa60'' frontend: a simple edit-and-go X11
application. 

In the micro directory there are additional Makefiles for compiling for
MSDOS, etc.


Have fun.
